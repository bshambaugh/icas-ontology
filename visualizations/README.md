Download OW2VOWL [1] to convert turtle files. 
Once the turtle file(s) are converted feed them into WebVowl which may be downloaded at [2] .

The source had to be slightly modified as in the mdfd-TTL-Source/ folder (eg. email.ttl -> cpemail.ttl).
The result of feeding the turtle file into OWL2VOWL is in owl2vowl-Output. (eg. cpemail.ttl -> cpemail.json).
